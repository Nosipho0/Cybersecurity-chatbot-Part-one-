This program initializes a cybersecurity chatbot by creating instances of audio, logo, and chatbot classes to handle sound, branding, and user interaction in a console-based application.
The `Audio` class is responsible for playing a `.wav` audio file when it is initialized. It gets the current project directory using `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory`, modifies the path by removing `bin\Debug\`, and appends `audio.wav` to form the full file path. It then calls the `Play_wav` method, which uses a `SoundPlayer` object to play the audio synchronously with `PlaySync()`. A `try-catch` block ensures that any file or playback-related errors are caught and displayed in the console. This allows the program to provide an audible greeting or sound effect when the chatbot starts.
The `Logo` class converts an image (`logo.jpg`) into ASCII art and displays it in the console when the class is instantiated. It first locates the image file by getting the project's base directory and adjusting the path to remove the `bin\Debug\` part. The image is loaded and resized to 90Ã—50 pixels for optimal console rendering. Then, it loops through each pixel, calculates the average brightness by combining the red, green, and blue values, and maps this brightness to an ASCII character based on intensity. Brighter pixels are represented by lighter characters like spaces or dots, while darker pixels use characters like `*`, `+`, or `:`. This creates a visually stylized text-based version of the image, simulating a logo or banner in the terminal window.
The `Chatbot` class provides an interactive console-based cybersecurity assistant that responds to user questions using keyword matching. When initialized, it welcomes the user, prompts them to enter their name, and then starts a chat loop. It defines a list of predefined keywords and corresponding replies related to cybersecurity topics like passwords, phishing, malware, and safe browsing. As the user types questions, the chatbot scans their input for any matching keywords and displays the relevant reply. If no keywords are found, it gives a default message. The chat continues until the user types "exit." The class also includes colored console output to improve readability and user experience, with messages styled for information, errors, prompts, and farewell.
